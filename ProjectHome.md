# The NAI Framework #
The NAI framework for Microsoft Surface and Android smartphones encapsulates the complexity of using smartphones for **non-anonymous user interaction on tabletop displays**.

The framework has been developed as part of the master thesis "Non-anonymous user interaction on tabletop displays" at IT University of Copenhagen, Demark by **Michael Thomassen** and **Thomas Berglund**, in 2011.

The wiki pages contain more information about [what the NAI framework is](Overview.md) (including a video). They also contain a small guide on how to [start the demo applications](InstallAndRun.md), and how you can [use the framework for your own projects](CreateYourOwnApp.md).

Happy coding!
